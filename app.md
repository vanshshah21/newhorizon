Below is a comprehensive list of changes and additions to apply acros entire lib folder to bring it in line with Flutter best-practices, eliminate UI/raster jank, and add robust error handling. Grouped by category:

Project & Analysis
• Add an analysis_options.yaml with flutter_lints to enforce style, catch errors early.
• Turn on sound null-safety and fix all warnings.
• Remove the debug banner (debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false) and run in profile/​release for performance testing.

Code Organization & Architecture
• Extract all API/network calls out of pages into dedicated service classes under lib/services/….
• Define plain-data models under lib/models/… (use json_serializable + build_runner, or freezed) instead of raw Map<String, dynamic>.
• Use a repository or provider layer (lib/repositories/…) to coordinate services + caching.
• Remove direct jsonDecode in widgets—have services return fully parsed objects.

Asynchronous & Main-Thread Work
• Wrap all heavy JSON parsing or list sorting inside compute() (or manual isolates).
• Never parse or filter large lists inside a build(), initState(), or inside setState().
• Debounce search input (TextField.onChanged) with a short Timer so you don’t re-filter on every keystroke.

Widget Rebuild / Render Optimizations
• Mark all stateless widgets and subtrees that never change as const.
• Wrap expensive visual subtrees (charts, heavy lists) in RepaintBoundary.
• For large lists, always use ListView.builder / GridView.builder + itemExtent or cacheExtent.
• Sample or reduce data-points before passing to your chart widgets so they only render e.g. 12–20 points.
• Pre-compile your shaders (see Flutter’s SkSL warm-up guide).

State Management & Caching
• Use Provider, Riverpod, or GetX—avoid large StatefulWidget pages doing everything.
• Cache API responses (in memory or with hive/shared_preferences) and show stale data immediately while refreshing in background.
• Implement pagination or infinite-scroll for endpoints returning large lists.

Error Handling & User Feedback
• In every service call wrap try/catch around DioException or HttpException, log via dart:developer.log, and surface a friendly retry UI.
• In your FutureBuilder, handle each snapshot state:
– waiting ▶︎ show a small spinner.
– error ▶︎ show a retry button and error message.
– data isEmpty ▶︎ show “No data available”.
• Extract a reusable ErrorView widget with a retry callback.
• For network calls, add timeouts, interceptors for automatic retry/back-off, and global error dialog on 401 (session expiry).

Theming & Consistency
• Centralize colors, text styles, paddings in lib/theme.dart.
• Use const EdgeInsets, const SizedBox, and avoid literal doubles scattered everywhere.

Build & Release Configuration
• Update your build.gradle to target ARM / ARM64 (drop x86 emulators).
• Enable ProGuard/R8 minification for Android and bitcode for iOS.
• Run flutter build apk --split-per-abi and test real-device performance.

Logging & Metrics
• Instrument key lifecycle events with Timeline.startSync/finishSync so you can trace slow startup or build phases in DevTools.
• Integrate Firebase or Sentry for crash reporting and performance monitoring.

Miscellaneous
• Defer non-critical init (analytics, logging) via Future.delayed(Duration.zero, …) after first frame.
• Evict large images or SVGs from memory when leaving screens.
• For any custom CustomPainter, implement shouldRepaint correctly to avoid needless redraws.
• Where you have repeated TextFormField date pickers, extract a single reusable widget.

Applying all of the above will:
– Offload parsing & sorting to isolates
– Stop heavy rebuilds & large widget trees
– Give users instant cached data + retry UIs
– Guarantee every frame stays under 17 ms on release.
